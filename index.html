	<h1>Hiya Friends</h1>
<p> 1. I'm Alexander R. Gargano a Junior in Communication Design at Washington University in St. Louis. </p>
<p> 2. I was born in Chicago, Il. and would love to be an illustrator after graduation or at least a junkie who can make a mean magazine spread. I'm taking this class for all the obvious reasons (creditz) yes, but I am also very interested in the direction visual and communicative arts is heading in the 21st century, which means having the basic of grasps in coding. 
<p> 3. Other than the simplest webpage designs or using inspect on sentences to change them for comedic effect, I have relatively little experience in HTML style coding. </p>
<p> 4. I'd be more than happy if I left the class with the ability to code an engaging interface for any type of website.</p>
<p> 5. A piece of art scanned onto a screen is so less interesting than seeing its counterpart in real life. People's attention spans are a lot shorter online than when not glaring at a screen, so visually engaging the audience will need to be approached with different methods.</p>
<p> 6. https://myspace.com Bring it back baby!! </p>
<p> 7. Can I say https://wikipedia.org without it being cheating? Because I still to this day read the Wikipedia after I read anything else, just to make sure I got 100% of the information.  </p>
<p> 8. https://zorbasismissing.com I stumbled across this website —run by the Greek type foundry Karlopoulos&Associates— in downtown Athens by scanning a QR code graffiti sticker. The combination of off-screen interaction, sleek design and seeming pointlessness all add up to a tiny gem of a website. (or any website that allows AdBlock honestly.)
